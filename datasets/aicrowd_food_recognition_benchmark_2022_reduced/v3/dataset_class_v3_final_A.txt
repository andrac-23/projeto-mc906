Prompt IA:

"I am training a CNN that recognizes food classes. I am currently trying to combine a few classes of my dataset to try to reduce confusion between similar images and to get more images for my CNN to learn from. If two classes are relatively similar, like white_bread and wholegrain_bread, I place them in a single class called bread. Can you help me do this for a few classes I have left? I want you to answer only the new class name, and, if you combine a class, the list of classes that compose it. Example of output:

bread [white_bread, wholegrain_bread] # class name is bread and the list of classes is [white_bread, wholegrain_bread]

Don't output my example. You can only combine the classes I sent you, and you don't need to combine every class. If you choose not to combine a class, just output its name unaltered. Did you understand?"
